### Set Up

* After cloning the repo into your local environment you will need to:
    * Create a '.env' file in the parent directory and define the variable 'OPENAI_API_KEY'
    * Navigate to the notebooks folder and run the 'AI_ML Ensemble Learning' notebook

#### Testing

* Any csv file can be added to the 'data' directory
    * The path must be refactored in the 'AI_ML Ensemble Learning' notebook to point to the new dataset
